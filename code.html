                    I worked as a SWE intern on Pluto's Insights team. In order to streamline the testing<br> process, 
                    I helped develop scripts to generate synthetic datasets used for 
                    testing<br>our medical screeners. I was responsible for generating hundreds of datasets to <br>extensively debug backend scripts. 
                    <br><br>I also implemented UI on the patient-facing website for better accessibility of<br> external resources on
                    diagnoses. <br><br>
                
                    <i>JUN - JUL 2021</i><br><br>
                    I worked on Pluto's Insights team to collaborate with other SWEs to develop algorithms<br>to standardize the writing of
                    medical screeners. Using this foundation, I wrote<br>screeners to test patients for specific diseases and recommend
                    treatments. <br><br>I also utilized an interaction library to parse
                    2 medical databases.

                    I collaborated on a project to create an algorithm that takes images, sequences them<br> based on a user's 
                    input order, and returns an animation. My research was focused on<br> capturing realistic eye movement
                     by studying human behavior/psychology.
